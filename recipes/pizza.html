    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Pizza is absoulutely amazing. It is the best thing that has even been invented on God's Green Earth. It tastes so good I have no idea what to do.</p>
    <p>Wow pizza is fuckin good. Get in my big belly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion</li> 
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Mushroom</li>        
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Make:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.
        </li>
        <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.</li>
        <li>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.</li>
